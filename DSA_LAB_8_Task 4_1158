 Task 4	 A hospital management system needs to maintain a list of patients waiting in line for consultation. Patients arrive at different times and may leave the queue if they cancel their appointment. Using the concept of a doubly linked list as an Abstract Data Type (ADT), design and implement a system that supports the following operations:

•Add a new patient to the end of the queue
•Remove a patient from the queue if they cancel
•Display the current list of patients in order
•Count how many patients are currently in the queue
Write a program to simulate this scenario using a singly linked list and demonstrate each operation with sample data.
